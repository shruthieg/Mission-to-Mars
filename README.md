# Mission to Mars

Web Scraping NASA Mars News, NASA Mars Space Image, NASA Twitter and U.S Geological survey sites have been scrapped to collect latest news and images. Scrapping was used as the data is frequently changing and users can request for a new scrape as well.

NASA Mars News: NASA publishes articles and latest developments related to Mars exploration. This scrape collects the title and a brief synopsis of the article.
NASA Mars Space Image: This site publishes selected images of Mars as featured images. The scrape was to pull the latest image.
NASA Twitter: NASA twitter feed contains Mars weather information. We scrape NASAâ€™s twitter feed to identify the latest weather post. Any non-weather posts are ignored.
U.S Geological Survey: Scrape was to collect the recent pictures of the hemispheres of Mars.
